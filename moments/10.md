# 凡人

也许这世界很大，也很危险<br>
但我还是想，继续往前走


这路上，或许会遇到很多很多<br>
相逢和离别、挣扎与选择、当然也会有，巧合和幸运<br>
我会牢牢抓住这些机缘，拼劲全力

或许起点越低，<br>
遇到真正改变自己命运的机会时，就会抓的越牢<br>
这并没有什么可耻的<br>
只要知道想去哪里，还有自己是从哪里出发的就好

我想...

<br>
<br>
<br>

Maybe this world is vast, and yes — dangerous<br>
But still, I want to keep moving forward<br>

On this road, I might encounter many things — <br>
Meetings and farewells, struggles and choices, and of course, moments of coincidence and luck<br>
I’ll hold on to these chances tightly, and give everything I have


Perhaps the lower the starting point<br>
The tighter you cling when you finally meet a chance that could change your fate<br>
There’s nothing shameful about that<br>
As long as you know where you’re going — and where you began — that’s enough

I think...

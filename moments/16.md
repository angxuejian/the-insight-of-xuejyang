# Peter Dinklage

I wish to confess,
I wish to confess

Just try not to wait until like me,you’re 29 before you find it

<br>

> Life advice from Peter Dinklage

I didn’t want a “day job”

I was an actor

I was a writer

I was a Bennington graduate

I had to get a day job

I dusted piano at a piano store on Ludlow Street for five months

I worked on the property of a Shakespearean Scholar for a year pulling weeds and removing bees nests

After 2 year of job and couch surfing

I got a job in application processing as a data enterer and I stayed for 6 years

I hated that job, and I clung to that job

<br>

> When you no longer tolerate something, you will start to change

When I was 29, I told myself: the next acting job I get no matter what it pays, I will, from now on, for better or worse, be a working actor
At 29, walking away from data processing

I was terrified

Ten years in a place without heat six years at a job I felt stuck in
Maybe I was afraid of change

He procrastinated because of fear of failures

But something good happened

I got a low paying job theater job in a play called “Imperfect Love”, which led to a film called “13 Moons” with the same writer, which led to other roles, which led to other roles, and I’ve worked as an actor ever since

The moments that define you have already happened and they will already happen again

The world might say you are not allowed to yet

I waited a long time out in the world before I gave myself permission to fail
Please, don’t even bother asking

Don’t bothering telling the world you are ready

Show it

Do it

What did Beckett say:

Ever tried

Ever failed

No matter

Try again

Fail again

Fail better

The world is yours

Don’t wait

Act now

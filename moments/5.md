# 她

又一次从她的学校回去。<br>
街边的小店已与白天不同。<br>
路灯下的景色让人垂涎、不能忘却、不能触碰、不能留存<br>

何时才能遇见她<br>
何时才能碰见那天的景色、温度


<br>
<br>
<br>

Once again, I walked bak from her school.<br>
The shops along the street looked different in the evening than by day.<br>
The sights beneath the streetlights — unforgettable, beyond reach, impossible to keep.<br>

When will I meet again?<br>
When will experiences the sights and warmth of that day once more?
